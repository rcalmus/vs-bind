The supplementary material in this folder comprises additional explanatory text, code and figures that together walk the reader through key VSA concepts referred to within the paper.


If you have MATLAB
------------------

All supplementary information can be found in "VSBIND_VSA_Walkthrough.mlx", which is a MATLAB Live Script. This is the MATLAB equivalent of Python's "Jupyter Notebooks" (and vice versa). To view this material, open the Live Script in MATLAB and then click "Run". On the left, the supplementary text, code and figures will walk you through a demonstration of principles described in the paper. On the right, the corresponding results will appear and scroll in sync with your reading of the document.


If you do not have MATLAB
-------------------------

If you do not have a MATLAB licence, you may instead view a static walkthrough of VSA operators and accompanying figures by opening "VSBIND_VSA_Walkthrough_For_Non_MATLAB_Licensees.html" in your web browser.
